# Student Social Media Addiction Analysis

An exploratory data analysis of the impact and patterns of social media addiction among students.

## Project Overview

This project delves into the dataset of students' social media usage to uncover patterns and insights related to social media addiction. Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to understand the various factors that correlate with social media addiction and visualize these relationships. This analysis can serve as a foundation for further research and the development of strategies to promote healthier social media habits among students.

## Dataset

The primary dataset used in this project is `Students Social Media Addiction.csv`. It contains various attributes related to students' demographics, social media usage patterns, and self-reported addiction levels. A cleaned version of the dataset, `studentsSocialMedia_cleaned.csv`, is also included.

Key features in the dataset may include:
* Age
* Gender
* Time spent on social media
* Frequency of social media use
* Self-reported addiction levels

## Installation

To run the analysis, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
